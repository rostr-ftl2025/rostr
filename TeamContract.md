# Team Contract
---
## Purpose of this Contract

This contract sets out shared expectations and commitments for how our team will collaborate during the course. It is designed to promote accountability, professionalism, and mutual support as we complete individual preparation, readiness assurance tests, in-class activities, and our course project.

---
## Team Norms and Expectations
### Preparation
Each team member commits to reading assigned materials and completing individual readiness work before class.

Members who come unprepared agree to accept reasonable consequences determined by the team (lower peer evaluation scores, other penalities decided by the team).

Reasonable Consequences include but not limited to: Buying the whole team a drink of their choice (non-alcoholic)

### Communication
We will use Instagram & Discord as our primary communication channel.

Team members will respond to messages within 18 hours on weekdays (unless otherwise specified).

All communication will remain respectful, professional, and constructive.
    

* Respectful and inclusive behaviour are necessary for smooth and productive communication. All members must display respectful and active listening skills, provide with input throught the timeline, get all work done within the agreed timeframe and provide other members with feedback.  

### Attendance and Participation
Members will attend all scheduled team meetings unless illness or emergencies occur.

If unable to attend the team meeting, a member must notify the team and the FTL TA's (if no-show during tutorial) in advance and provide input asynchronously.

During team activities, every member will contribute ideas and actively engage in the discussion.

### Decision Making
Decisions will be made by consensus when possible.

If consensus cannot be reached, a vote will be taken; majority rules.

### Work Quality
All deliverables should be completed on time, tested, and meet the agreed quality standard.

Members agree to review each otherâ€™s work constructively before submission.

Each major Pull Request will be reviewed by at least one team members.

## Decision Making

* All major changes made that affect/alter the core idea must be approved by the majority of the team. Any minor changes that do not affect core logic, may be made individually. 

---
## Conflict resolution

* All conflict will tried to be resolved internally within the team during weekly meetings. If internal conflict resolution does not work, TA's will be involved and asked to mediate and help with communication. In extreme cases, Professors will be involved and may result in penalities decided by the two parties involved. 

---

## Accountability

* Reliability and accountability are also important aspects of teamwork. Completing their share of the work in a timely manner, seeking assistance from teammates/TAs/instructors when required, and staying on tasked (self motivation) are responsibilities of all team members
