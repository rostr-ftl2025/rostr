# Team Contract

**Your team is free to revise this contract as your team wishes; we have scaffolded it with a recommended structure similar to the provided sample on Quercus.**

After you reflect on past teamwork experiences and brainstorm a list of actions required for a positive teamwork experience, answer these questions. 

Once you have all agreed on the contents of the team contract, make a PR to merge your team contract into the main branch of your team's repo on GitHub.

**Please remember to remove any of the initial instruction text when your team finalizes your team contract; it should resemble the provided sample once complete, but with details specific to the expectations and norms agreed to by your entire team.**

## Purpose of this Contract

This contract sets out shared expectations and commitments for how our team will collaborate during the course. It is designed to promote accountability, professionalism, and mutual support as we complete individual preparation, readiness assurance tests, in-class activities, and our course project.

---
## Team Norms and Expectations
a) Preparation
Each team member commits to reading assigned materials and completing individual readiness work before class.

Members who come unprepared agree to accept reasonable consequences determined by the team (e.g., lower peer evaluation scores).

b) Communication
We will use Instagram as our primary communication channel.

Team members will respond to messages within 18 hours on weekdays.

All communication will remain respectful, professional, and constructive.

c) Attendance & Participation
Members will attend all scheduled classes and team meetings unless illness or emergencies occur.

If unable to attend, a member must notify the team and the FTL TA's in advance and provide input asynchronously.

During team activities, every member will contribute ideas and engage in the discussion.

d) Decision Making
Decisions will be made by consensus when possible.

If consensus cannot be reached, a vote will be taken; majority rules.

e) Work Quality
All deliverables should be completed on time, tested, and meet the agreed quality standard.

Members agree to review each otherâ€™s work constructively before submission.

Each Major Pull Request will be reviewed by at least two team members.
